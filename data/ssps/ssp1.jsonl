This document can be found in the CivicActions Compliance Docs GitHub repository at <https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs>.\n\nThis is Agency common control. More data about implementation can be obtained from the Agency common control catalog.\n\nAccess control policy and procedures are documented in the The Project SSP. Access to Project operational information or system resources is limited to only authorized users, programs or processes.

{"control": "AC-3", "text": "In this architecture, AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Amazon S3 enforce access to the AWS infrastructure and data in Amazon S3 buckets. The baseline IAM groups and roles are associated with access policies to align user accounts with personnel functions related to infrastructure/platform management (e.g. Billing, Amazon EC2/VPC/Amazon RDS systems administration, I.T. auditing, etc.) Login/API access is restricted to those users for whom the organization has authorized and created, or federated, IAM user accounts, and assigned the appropriate IAM group and/or role memberships. Amazon S3 buckets have specific access control policies assigned to restrict access to those IAM users who are assigned the appropriate IAM roles/groups.\n\nAccess control in Drupal is enforced by authentication via a unique username/password for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user\u2019s privileges, permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.\nThe anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Drupal Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.\n\nAccess control in Ilias is enforced by authentication via Shibboleth single sing on (SSO) for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user\u2019s privileges, permissions, and access are provided on the principle of least privilege.\nThe anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. Project Administrators, HR Managers, and Org Managers are the only roles that can create new user accounts.\n\nThe The Project ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted in Section 1.1.1 of the Project SSP. The technical support staff ensures that access to security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each instance. Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless explicitly permitted.\n"}
